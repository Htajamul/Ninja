            A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms 
            a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether
             a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing,
              particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
